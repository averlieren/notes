    \section{Test Corrections}
    No points were missed, however, to clear a misunderstanding:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[7.] Show that
        \begin{equation}
            y_{1} = t^{-1};\quad y_{2} = t^{1/2}
        \end{equation}
        form a fundamental set of solutions for
        \begin{equation}
            L[y] = 2ty'' + 3y' - \frac{1}{t}y = 0; t > 0
        \end{equation}
        Wrong:
        \begin{equation}
            L[c_{1}t^{-1} + c_{2}t^{1/2}] = 0 \implies c_{1}L[t^{-1}] + c_{2}L[t^{1/2}] = 0
        \end{equation}
        Correct:
        \begin{equation}
            L[t^{-1}] = 0;\quad L[t^{1/2}] = 0
        \end{equation}
        Then, prove that
        \begin{equation}
            W[t^{-1}, t^{1/2}] \neq 0
        \end{equation}
    \end{enumerate}
    The wrong assumption proved the principle of superposition (the linear combination of $y_{1}, y_{2}$ are also solutions to $L[y]$), however, it does not prove that $y_{1}, y_{2}$ are indeed solutions to $L[y]$.
    To correctly do the problem, one must compute the linear operator on $y_{1}$ and $y_{2}$, and ensure that they equal 0.
